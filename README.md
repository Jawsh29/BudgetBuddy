# BudgetBuddy
Budgeting App to track finances and visualize expenses. Currently very basic. I would like to improve the Budget Reports page,
this is my first time using matplotlib so I'm sure there is a better way to organize the data. I then want to add a way to 
permanently save the Budget Reports in a file so it can be access after closing out of the app. Also, I plan on updating the UI.
A classmate recommended CustomTkinter and I intend on looking into it to improve the look of the GUI
