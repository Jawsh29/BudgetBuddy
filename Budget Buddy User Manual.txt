Hello! Thank you for using Budget Buddy v1.0
Budget Buddy is a budgeting tool meant to help you keep track of your 
monthly expenses. It is currently a work in progress with many new features on the way!

Getting Started
First you should gather all of your receipts for the month or 
open your banking account to see all of your recent transactions
Now select "Set Goals" in the home page.

Setting Goals
In the Set Goals Window, define categories of spending you would like to set 
spending goals for. Set a monetary goal for each category. Now Press "Add Goal".
Once done, exit the Set Goals Window.

Entering Expenses
Now select "Enter Expenses". In the dropdown menu select the category you want to enter 
expenses for. Now Add each expense you have for the selected category. Make sure to press "Add Expense" for each item. Once you've enter all expenses you'd like to calculate

Viewing Report
Now a new window appears called "Expense Report". Here you can compare your set goals vs how much you spent per category. After reviewing, you can save your data to a csv file which can be loaded at a later time.
